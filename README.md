**Main Research Question**

Digitalization of student record management made the process more efficient and effective. Gone are the days searching through a pile of files to find a student record. Everything nowadays is computerized, and all records are stored in databases, where administrators are given the luxury of accessing records instantly.
With the ever-increasing usage of these systems, begs the question can they be further improved to be more efficient, effective and secure. Currently, the majority of the higher educational institutes use information systems of centralized nature. Due to this, they are prone to many issues of security, integrity, availability and scalability. Therefore, we decided to address these issues and provide a practical, innovative and effective solution. We proposed a secure, decentralized credit platform for higher education institutes based on blockchain technology.
However, due to the novelty of blockchain technology, apart from its most prominent use in cryptocurrency, there hasn’t been a lot of application in other domains. The literature currently available on utilizing blockchain technology in information systems is severely limited. Almost all of them only provide broad overviews and don’t go into detail of the process involved. Furthermore, none of the projects has been released either as an open-source or a commercial product. This project involves research into investigating the most efficient, effective and secure methods of incorporating decentralization and blockchain technology to the proposed system.



**Individual Research Questions**

*Component 01* - 
Currently, the majority of HEIs store their academic data in the context of central repositories on enterprise servers. These databases are structured to be exclusively accessed by an institutions’ staff in dedicated online systems, hence with little or no interoperability. They have full control over their students’ records and are largely bureaucratized. The centralized nature of these systems is prone to issues of security, integrity, availability, and scalability. Since the information stored in these systems are open for modifications, the risk always exists of malicious intruders penetrating the system and modifying the information. The complexity further increases when students and HEIs have to provide completed course records to outside stakeholders such as employers, ministry of education or ranking frameworks. On account of such occasions, manual archives must be given by the HEIs to be considered as confirmed and official. These processes take a very long time and often becomes a very challenging issue at ground level. Therefore, we decided to address this issue and provide a practical, innovative, and effective solution using blockchain technology and decentralization. However, since the blockchain technology is still an emerging technology, the use of blockchain to education is still in its early stages. Therefore, very few amounts of solutions were published and covered under this domain. Due to these factors, most of the solutions at current mainly lack proper data transfer mechanisms while lacking in user-friendliness, and usability. Therefore, this component of the research investigates the most secured and effective blockchain-based data transferring mechanisms and how can it be implemented throughout the system while designing and implementing the client API and the frontend web application with giving the users the ability to easily and more efficiently interact with while maintaining a high usability and user-friendliness throughout the system. 

*Component 02* - 
Digitalization of student record management made the process more efficient and effective. Gone are the days searching through a pile of files to find a student record. Everything nowadays is computerized, and all records are stored in databases, where administrators are given the luxury of accessing records instantly. With the ever-increasing usage of these systems, begs the question of how secure they are. Considering the sensitivity of the information handled by these systems, they should be highly transparent and secured. Only authorized personal should be able to manipulate these systems. Different users with different permission levels should only be allowed to access the resources allocated to them.However, one bottleneck preventing higher security for these systems is their centralized nature. Therefore, we proposed a blockchain based higher education credit platform. The proposed system utilizes all the benefits inherently associated with decentralization, and blockchain technology such as transparency, higher security and immutability of data. In the modern world which is ruled by information and craves higher privacy and information security, we believe that our proposed CreditX platform, which incorporates and is secured by a blockchain based authentication model will be in high demand and will a high commercial value. However, since blockchain is still an emerging technology, apart from its most prominent use in cryptocurrency, there haven’t been a lot of applications in other domains. Therefore, this component of the research investigates the most efficient and effective blockchain based user authentication models in a comparative framework to determine the improvements to be made and how the most efficient and effective authentication model can be incorporated into our proposed CreditX platform. Furthermore, it looks into how the higher security the proposed platform inherits due to blockchain and decentralization technologies can be further enhanced. 


*Component 03* - 
With the rapidly growing numbers of the human population, increases the demand for every product and service on earth. Education is one of those services needed by humans. Although not all of the humans go through higher education, the increasing number of the human population can still affect the demand for it. This means more people at universities, making it more difficult to manage the institute. Many systems have been implemented to make it easier for universities to manage their student information, more specifically student academic progress. The academic progress is usually kept in form of credits, at universities. Before the computer was invented, all of these records were kept on paper. This was quite a tedious task. With the invention of computers, new solutions have been introduced in form of computer software. Those systems do the task, yet there is a concern of availability, security, and trust over these systems due to their centralized architecture. Blockchain technology could rectify most of these problems just by its nature. So, as a solution to this problem, Credit X: A Decentralized and Secure Credit Platform for Higher Education Institutes Based on Blockchain Technology is introduced in this document. The Credit X system uses blockchain technology to provides the extra availability, security and trust, that other centralized systems could not. The business logic of this system is implemented in an Ethereum “Smart Contract” which is deployable on a private blockchain network. The Smart Contract will handle all the backend operations of the system, such as grading students’ subjects in a relevant manner, granting access to third-parties with student approval, etc. This Smart Contract development is somewhat different from ordinary software development, as programming languages specifically “Solidity” and other relevant tools are novel to the industry. Because the novelty of the available development environments, some of the basic functionalities available in traditional software development environments have to be manually implemented by the developer, according to the requirement. Since this is a blockchain-based system, the system architecture is quite different from other traditional software systems, which can be somewhat difficult for people to understand quickly. 


*Component 04* - 
For a private blockchain to function, there must be a network of nodes. These nodes represent the decentralized platform. But there is no specific way to implement this. Usually, this node configuration is done by executing a bunch of CLI commands. This is a very tedious process because these commands are very lengthy and take some time to execute. And network administrators have to execute the same command every time they deploy a new node to the network. Other than that, all the mining processes must be started by executing CLI commands. This is a harder approach to a network administrator who does not has a broad knowledge of blockchain technology. This private blockchain has a state to monitor. This state is consisting of a collection of properties such as average block time, average network hash rate, network uptime, gas limit, gas price, etc. CLI commands are also used here to retrieve the values of each property. In a normal situation, these properties cannot view within a single dashboard. The only option is to view them one by one. Without watching them in a single dashboard, network administrators cannot get a clear idea about network state. This can be led to poor network maintaining choices in the future. Other than that, all these steps are somehow involved in CLI command executions. Executing CLI command and viewing the status of a network is also a tedious process.


**Main Objective**

The main objective of this proposed system is to design and develop a distributed, secure and trustworthy credit and grade platform called CREDIT X utilizing blockchain technology.


**Individual Research Objectives**

*Component 01* - To design and develop a blockchain client API enabling the interaction among the frontend web application, blockchain network, smart contract, and digital wallet while handling all the data transfers more securely and efficiently.  
 
*Component 02* - To research into blockchain based user authentication models currently proposed,  in a comparative framework in order to determine the improvements to be made and how to incorporate the most efficient, effective, and secure model to our proposed CredtiX platform. 

*Component 03* - To develop a Smart Contract using Solidity programming language to function as a student credits and grades management system’s backend service, which will be deployable on an “Ethereum” private blockchain network specifically designed for Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology.

*Component 04* - To implement a decentralized, scalable platform for the private blockchain system to function. This includes node configuration, node deployment, and node peering.
 
**System Architecture**

Our proposed CreditX platform, allows third party employees to verify their applicants’ academic performance via an online interface while ensuring all the academic transcripts are securely stored in a private blockchain. Furthermore, this guarantees the security and verifiability of the academic transcripts for students as well as for the interested third parties. [Figure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/122Q2yb2wXXEMehw4lKCMIIMhBze23Zee/view?usp=sharing) provided here, illustrates the high-level architectural diagram of the proposed platform. It presents the four main components of the CreditX platform alongside their interdependencies and interactions. The smart contract component is responsible for handling the business logic of the platform. It deploys smart contracts written in Solidity programming language in into the private Ethereum blockchain network, which are then executed based on predefined conditions in order to perform business logic of the platform. The frontend module component is responsible for the implementation of the web application and the handling of data transfers between the private blockchain network and the web application. The frontend module utilizes remote procedure calls for the communication and is a combination of the following three sub-modules. 1) User Interfaces, 2) Smart Contract Application Binary Interface, 3) Frontend logic to interact with the blockchain. The authentication model provides secure user authentication for the proposed platform and makes the process more convenient for the end-user while encapsulating the complexities behind blockchain technology. Lastly, the private blockchain component is responsible for the maintenance of the Ethereum private blockchain in which the proposed platform will be deployed. The private network will be developed using Geth (Go Ethereum) and will be heavily customized to increase the efficiency and performance of CreditX smart contracts. Furthermore, it will provide a graphical user interface for performing configurations of the network making it easier to obtain information such as status of each node deployed, average block mining time, mining time of the last block etc.
